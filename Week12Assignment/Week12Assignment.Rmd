# Assignment overview

For this assignment, we should take information from a relational database and migrate it to a NoSQL database of our own choosing, preferably in R . 

## SQL Database

For the relational database, I chose the Employees sample database was developed by Patrick Crews and Giuseppe Maxia and provides a combination of a large base of data spread over six separate tables and consisting of 4 million records in total. The structure is compatible with a wide range of storage engine types. Infomation about the Employees sample database is available on <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-introduction.html>

The following diagram provides an overview of the structure of the Employees sample database.

## NoSQL database

Though I planned using Neo4j in this assignment, I ended up using MongoDB because of technical issues in running Neo4j with R in my laptop.

# Load packages
```{r}
library(RMySQL)
library(dplyr)
library(mongolite)
library(rjson)
```

# Establish SQL Connection

```{r}
con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='test_user', password='data607', dbname='employees', host='localhost')
```

# Basic use of SQL

```{r}
dbListTables(con)
dbListFields(con, "titles")

sql <- "SELECT * FROM titles LIMIT 5;"
dbGetQuery(con, sql)

```

# SQL Queries

Read some of the information from all tables in the database into a data frame in R. I combined different tables into a single data frame.

```{r}
employee_list <- dbReadTable(con, 'employees')
str(employee_list)
```

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT   e.emp_no AS empID, concat(e.first_name,' ', e.last_name) AS employee, e.gender, t.title, d.dept_name
        FROM employees e JOIN titles t ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
        JOIN dept_emp de ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
        JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no = de.dept_no
        ORDER BY e.last_name, e.first_name;"
df1 <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
str(df1)
head(df1)

sql <- "SELECT   d.dept_name, concat(e.first_name,' ', e.last_name) AS manager 
        FROM employees e JOIN dept_manager dm ON dm.emp_no = e.emp_no
        JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no = dm.dept_no
        ORDER BY e.last_name, e.first_name;"
df2 <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
str(df2)
head(df2)
dbDisconnect(con)
```

The following code adds the managers' names from df2 to df1.

```{r}
 df <- df1 %>% inner_join(df2, by = c("dept_name" = "dept_name"))
head(df)
dim(df)
```


# Import data into MongoDB

This part of the work follows the instructions posted on  <https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-mongodb-with-r/>

```{r}
# create connection, database and collection
mongo_db = mongo(collection = "df", db = "employees")
str(mongo_db)

# Insert the data
mongo_db$insert(df)

# check if we have inserted df
mongo_db$iterate()$one()

# check the number of employees inserted
length(mongo_db$distinct("empID"))
length(employee_list$emp_no)


```


# Advantages and disadvantages

* NoSQL is capable of storing, processing, and managing huge amounts of data.
* NoSQL focus on better response time, scale while maintaining availability and performance.
* SQL can be an easier syntax to work with rather than JSON for NoSQL
* The NoSQL database demanded a lot more technical skills from me  with the installation and use than SQL did when I first used in the beginner of the course.
