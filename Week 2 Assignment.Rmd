# SQL and R

In this assignment a database called movie_ratings was created in MySQL. The database contains about recent popular movies choosen at random.  People that I know (friends, family members, and myself included) rated each of these movie that on a scale of 1 (not good) to 5 (excellent). For the movies not seen no rate was provided.

The movie_ratings.db can be downloaded from 
https://github.com/bsosnovski/DATA607/blob/master/Week2Assignment/Week2Assignment_MySQL/movie_ratings_db.sql

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Movie_Ratings Schema Diagram", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Movie_Ratings_Schema_Diagram.jpeg")
```


## Load packages
```{r}
library(knitr)
#library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)


```

## Establish Connection
```{r}
con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='test_user', password='data607', dbname='movie_ratings', host='localhost')
```

## Basic Use
```{r}
dbListTables(con)
dbListFields(con, "critics")
```

## SQL Queries
```{r}
sql <- "SELECT * FROM critics"
dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```

```{r}
Movies <- dbReadTable(con, 'movies')
str(Movies)
Movies
```

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT * FROM ratings"
dbGetQuery(con, sql, n=5)
```

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT   c.FirstName, m.Title, r.Rate 
        FROM movies m JOIN ratings r ON r.MovieID = m.MovieID 
        JOIN critics c ON r.CriticID = c.CriticID 
        ORDER BY c.CriticID, m.MovieID;"
result <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
result
```

## SQL Aggregate functions
```{r}
num_rates <- "SELECT m.title, COUNT(*) FROM movies m
        JOIN ratings r ON m.movieID = r.MovieID
        GROUP BY m.title"
dbGetQuery(con, num_rates)
```

```{r}
avg_ratings <- "SELECT m.title, AVG(Rate)FROM movies m
        JOIN ratings r ON m.movieID = r.MovieID
        GROUP BY m.title"
dbGetQuery(con,avg_ratings)
dbDisconnect(con)
